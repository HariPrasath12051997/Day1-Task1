Write a blog about Object and Internal Representation of the JavaScripts?

         *  The Object is Quite Different for the Primitve Data Types
         *  Each Object contains the Primitive Datatypes 
         *  And the Object will be in the formet of {'Key':'value'}
         *  It will be not followed in the Index form and will not nbe in the formet of Array.
         *  Key value will be unique and value will be differ.
         *  Key should be in form of String,Number,Boolean, null and Undefined.
         *  Syntax for geting key ---> Object.keys(obj).
         *  Synatx for getting value --->Object.Values(obj).
